        Monica is an aspiring graphic developer. Currently studying at Srishti
        design institute. She is an enthusiastic learner who will step beyond of
        her comfort zone to learn new things and seize opportunities, which
        drives her creative juices. She aspires to find love and enjoyment in
        all she does. She knows how to focus on the positives and motivate
        others to do the same. She has versatility in her art practices. She is
        polishing her skills and finding her style with continuous practice and
        personal projects that she is up to every now and then. She is driven to
        multitasking by FOMO since she just does not like a missed opportunity.
        She desires a life full of rich experiences for which she is willing to
        go above and beyond; 'hustle' is the most wholesome feeling she seeks.
        <br />
        She lets her music take care of her creative blocks. ​​​​​​​And little
        hops of excitement and elaborate hand gestures are constant.
